### About Me

Hi! I'm a sophomore at UCSD studying Neurobiology and Computer Science. I'm obsessed with the biological mechanism and technological potential of the brain. I joined the [Chalasani Lab](https://chalasani.salk.edu/) at Salk Institute in 2022, studying the foraging behavior of C. elegans. I'm also an undergraduate [CSE](https://cse.ucsd.edu/)tutor at UCSD, helping students debug codes during one-on-one tutor sessions. 
and I hope to do cool things with my interdisciplinary background.
